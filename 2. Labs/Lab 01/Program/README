## Reflection

This program ended up being vastly different then my initial brainstorm mostly becuase of one reason
and that is that I chose to use shifts.  In my brainstorm I was able to understand the need for bitwise
operators and other things but I was going to attempt to convert the users number back and forth from 
binary and uses division and remainders to shift the data about.  However upon starting the code I realized
the emense effort that would require and that with shifting I can avoid manual binary conversions all together.
That being said the general gist of my brainstorm was still followed but simply the execution steps that were
altered.
