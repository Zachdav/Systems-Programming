stat.cpp
	
	Create an input stream to pull in the users integers delimited by a space and add
	them to a variable total as well as square it and add it to a variable
	squaredTotal.  Print the variable total to the user, to print the average print
	the sum divided by n (a counter incrementing for every new number), and print 
	squared total.  To present the variance we only need the 3 stats we already printed
	and stored.

minmax.cpp

	Store the users first entry in both a min and max variable.  After that create a for
	loop that cinâ€™s a next int and compares it to both variables.  If it is smaller than
	the current min or bigger than the current max induce a swap.  After iterating 
	through all of the users ints print the two variables min and max.

degrees.cpp

	Retrieve the users integer value that represents a temperature in degrees celsius
	and store it into a variable.  Multiply the variable by 9/5 the conversion ratio 
	and re-store it back into the variable.  Create a loop to truncate all digits beyond
	the hundredths place and print the result to the user.

time.cpp

	Simply use a loop that will divides the seconds first storing the remainder in a
	variable for seconds.  Continue this process for minutes, hours, and finally days
	storing the remainders in there own respective variables.  After that loop is 
	complete in descending order print the variables to the user.

endtime.cpp

	Accept 2 variables from the user the first being the current time in 24 clock format
	the second being the time that has passed.  Use division and modulo to modify the 
	second number so that after 60 it i will add one to the hundreds place or the hour.
	Finally print the start time change in time and the end time to the user.
