	For this lab there are there major parts dealing with command line arguments, low
level file I/O, and the use of ncurses.

	For the command line arguments problem I will write the main to accept up to two 
arguments and if the user includes the last argument or the file they wish to open i will
resume code as normal.  If however, they do not include the second argument i.e. if argc2 ==
null then i will prompt the user at that point as to what file they want to open.  From that
point the code will pick up as if they entered it as an argument and move on.

	For the opening of file I/O in this particular problem we need to consult the use of
ncurses.  For the reading in of the low-level file I/O itself i will construct a program
similar to that of the one that supa’ mike constructed in class this week. The key 
differences however come in when we begin to print the result to the screen.  We will have 
to start by using initscr(); which will start up ncurses.  Then use printw(——); to print
the contents of the file.  Obviously before this line I will need to actually read in 
content.  Then after i have “printed” it all i will call refresh(); which will literally 
print out the contents to the screen for the user to see the file they requested.  Then I 
will use getch(); to wait for the users input to say that they are done reading the file and
want to go back into nike.  When i get that input i will finally call endwin(); to end 
curses.
