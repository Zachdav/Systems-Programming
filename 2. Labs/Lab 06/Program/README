## Instructions

To clean my code (i.e., remove any compiled files), type:

```
$ make clean
```

To compile only one of the files type:

```
$ make <file_name>
```

To compile my both programs, type:

```
$ make
```

To run my code (after compiling it), type:

```
$ ./lab06 <with or without a filename>
```

or

```
$ ./lab06test
```

## Reflection

	In my breakout brainstorm the main idea and layout of the program was correct
	but the specifics needed a lot of help.  For example in my breakout i did 
	realize that the lab had three main ways that it could run.  One is too many 
	arguments, two is that there was exactly two arguments, and lastly one means 
	not enough and we need a file name.  This was the overall layout of my main 
	function.  I had three if statements that handled each of these three cases 
	proparly and ending the program at the end of each if statement because they 
	will not need the other two.  Within each statement i either told the user to 
	use less arugments, opened the file in their argumentor asked them to provide 
	a file.  This two i understood in my brainstorm.  The key difference in my 
	actual lab design and my brainstorm is making open, read, and close functions 
	to make the code more readable.  Within each function i do the three main 
	things i mention in my brainstorm if the user provide a filename.  First in 
	the open function check for any opening errors and if there are any display 
	them to the user through the ncurses screen.  If however there are no errors 
	the program will continue on with the read function.  Again in my brainstorm 
	i basically describe exactly what my read does correctly using a char[] to 
	hole the values of the file.  Lastly the close function was not meantioned in 
	my brainstorm and needed to be because you need to check for any errors when 
	closing the file which is exactly what i do in the lab.  

	Over all the basics of my brainstorm was correct if you forget that i did not 
	include checking for closing errors.  However, the lab itself was much more 
	complicated because i needed to split up the three main functions of the 
	program into functions which i did not touch on in my brainstorm.
