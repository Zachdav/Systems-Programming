Breakout Brainstorm 10-07-15

	This week I have had two tests already and two tomorrow including yours so 
unfortunately I have not had a chance to begin the project yet but i have looked at the
instruction sheet and do have a plan.  
	For the function display and user interface portion of the project i will be using 
the ncurses library and its methods to produce a text editor capable of immediate editing.  
I will use ncurses to provide a file drop down menu that will allow the user to see, save as, 
and open.  Those are all the necessary user interface part of the project

	The other part of the project is to actually allow the user to save and open what 
they actually have typed in the text editor.  For this i will have the text editor create a
workspace directory and have all of the files saved there unless the user uses save as. In 
that case i will have the file saved where they dictate. To actually complete the save and
open procedures I will use the same low level i/o type coding as i did in the lab06.
