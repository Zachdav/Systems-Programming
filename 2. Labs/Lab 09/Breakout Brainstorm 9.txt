Breakout Brainstorm 10-21-15

	What we know about chmod: It is a linux utility that takes in two arguments the first of which
is the file path of the file being worked with and the second argument is the octal or symbolic 
representation of the permissions you want to change it to.

	For this breakout we will need to first handle issues pertaining to the arguments, in both 
quantity and type.  For example my program will only accept two arguments no more and no less so if
the number of args is not two this needs to be handled.  Also what the arguments are will always be
the same.  So the first must always be the file that is being worked with and the second must be the
octal or symbolic representation of its permissions.

	The other errors that will need to be handled are:
		the program caller does not have permissions to alter the permissions
		the file in question does not exist/or something in the file path does not exist
		the arguments are in the correct format such as octal

	Once the program is being called and all inputs are finally valid the program should proceed
in one of two ways determined by an if statement.  If the second argument has a leading 0 then it is 
representing permissions in octal and i can proceed with the chmod function.  Else the argument
is using symbolic representation and they need to be altered to either the correct symbols or octal
which can then be passes in chmod function.

	Finally there needs to be a formatted output to the user if all permission mode changes were
successful and the program should exit on success.  If the change in mode failed the user needs to be 
altered to this and as with all errors the program needs to be exited on failure.

	What i expect to learn from this lab are the basic ins and outs of the chmod, fchmod, and
fchmodat functions and gain a better understanding for error handling and file permissions.
