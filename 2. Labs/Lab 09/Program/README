## Instructions

To clean my code (i.e., remove any compiled files), type:

```
$ make clean
```


To compile my program, type:

```
$ make
```

To run my code (after compiling it), type:

```
$ ./chmod -sym MODE[,MODE]... FILE
```

or

```
$ ./chmod -oct OCTAL-MODE FILE
```

## Reflection

	This lab had three main parts within that mainly needed to be 
dealt with.  The first being basic error handling. The second being
changing the appropriate files permissions as the user running the 
utility has requested if possible with octal.  The third and final is 
the same as above but you are required to do it with symbols.

	To deal with basic error handling we need to first check that 
the user has entered the appropriate number of arguments, which is always
3 additional arguments.  If there are more or less arguments i notified
the user and exited with failure which is exactly what i predicted 
in my breakout.  In my breakout i also was correct when i said we needed
to check that the current user has permissions that the file exists and
that the remaining arguments match the -oct or -sym argument.  What I was
unprepared for and forgot in my breakout was checking that the user has
entered -oct or -sym and not some thing else.

	In my breakout i claimed that when the user passes in the octal 
permissions that they want to change the file to I could just store that
and the filename in const char* and pass them into the chmod().  However
after using my brain and documentation i realized that it was a little more
complex than that and that i needed a switch statements and consts like
S_IRWXU to set the permissions and after reading in all 3 numbers combining
them and passing that integer into the chmod();

	For the symbols in my breakout i stated that i would need a 
switch statement in a while loop that deals with each char in the 2nd
argument and this is exactly correct.  Having every possible char case
i used ints to detect whether the user has included that in their argument
and the same consts from earlier with logic to set the permissions.
