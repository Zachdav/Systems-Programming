	As of right now with project 2 i have complete the chmod, cat, mkdir utilities and am
working on the ls utility right now.
	For the extension part of the project we now have to tackle rm, ln, penv, stat, pwd, 
kill, and chown by Monday at 11:55 at night.
	For the penv and pwd utilities there are great examples posted on piazza by Supaâ€™ Mike
that show the correct ways to construct the utilities.
	For rm i will need to include the cstdio function to use the remove function to delete
the file. If however that file is the directory type then its contents needs to be deleted recursively and then the directory itself needs to be deleted.
	For ln i will need to  use a system call to create a hard link to an existing file with
the option of a symbolic link to the file with -S 
	For the stat utility the the output to the standard screen needs to be the same as that 
of the GNU implementation which means calling a lot of the information in the stat struct
	For the kill utility the specified signal is sent the the specified PID and if not signal 
is specified then the SIGTERM signal is sent.  Also the option of -s SIGNAL needs to be handled 
so the user can pass in a custom signal
	For the final utility chown I need to be able to change the ownership of the file with
respect to whether the owner or group was passed in.
