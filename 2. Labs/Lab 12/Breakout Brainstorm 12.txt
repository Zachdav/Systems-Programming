Breakout Brainstorm 10-21-15

	For this breakout most of it will be parsing the command line arguments for most of the lab.
In our own pseudo “bash” we will be getLine and parse the line looking for one of the seven options
listed in the instructions sheet.  There will also for error purposes I will have a final else 
statement that says you have not used this program correct try again.  Other than that there will be 
a tiny bit of logic to deal with piping.  I will assume that the input won’t be correct other than that 
there will always be spaces between arguments.
