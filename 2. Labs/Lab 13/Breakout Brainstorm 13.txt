Breakout Brainstorm 11-18-15

	For this lab we are building off of the previous lab adding the utility
for cd, exit, and help.  Also I will need to adjust the current prompt of my
lab so that instead of printing the whole absolute path we replace the "home"
directory with the "~".
	We will need to make sure that the shell program redirect the six possible 
signals listed in that lab description.  That being said the child process needs
to accept the same six signals and uses their default disposition.
	And the majority of this lab will be spent making simple foreground processes
by forking having the child process complete the job while the parent uses waitpid
to wait for the child process to complete.
