## Reflection

	This was not quite as difficult as I had led myself to believe in my 
breakout but certainly still very difficult as an overall lab.  The good news is
this is most of the project completed.
	The first thing i did was fix the prompt to display as the example from 
the project instructions sheet be indentifying the home directory and replacing 
it with a ~ unless you are above the default home directory.
	Second I added and refined the three required options exit, cd, and help.
By lab 12 I had default exit already implemented all i needed to do was to add 
the users ability to pass in their own integer N to represent the exit status.
For cd I used my old code from project two as a reference since it needed to be
implemented on a low level and for help i used a combination of GNU's help and 
the project instruction sheet.
	Dealing with the signals was as easy as SIG_IGN to the specified signals 
in the parent and SIG_DFL in the child processes.
	The most difficult portion of this project was dealing with piping and 
forking of course.  For no pipes it was fairly simple in that it was just once 
job and one fork.  With pipes however it got much harder. The main idea that i 
implemented was just to loop through the command provided and parse them into 
separate jobs and then parse each job as if there were no pipes since i dealt 
with read and write ends of pipes early on.
