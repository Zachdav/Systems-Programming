## Instructions

To clean my code (i.e., remove any compiled files), type:

```
$ make clean
```

To compile my editor, type:

```
$ make
```

To run my code (after compiling it), type:

```
$ ./lab06 <with or without a filename>
```

## Reflection
	
	For the most part what i planned in both of my breakout 
brainstorms were correct, minus a couple of small details.  Most of
what i had coded for lab06 was used and was a great building block 
for this textEditor.  That being said a lot of things had to be altered
in my functions taken from lab06.  One good example is the printw 
statements had to be changed to waddstr to add a char array to the
textfield within any of the windows i created.  
	Beyond lab06 I also needed to create functions that would
create a nonexistant file as well as a function to write to a file.
	As far as the TUI with ncurses was concerned i did not have 
a great grasp of what i would need to do for this in either of my
brainstorms.  As it turns out i decided to create a window for the 
text above a window that bordered it as well one for the menu, title, 
and document name.  I did not anticipate this but it made working with
the TUI much easier.
