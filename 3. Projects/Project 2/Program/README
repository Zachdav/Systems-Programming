## Instructions

To clean my code (i.e., remove any compiled files), type:

```
$ make clean
```

To compile my editor, type:

```
$ make
```

To run my code (after compiling it), type:

```
$ ./utiltiy_name <with appropriate parameters>
```

## Reflection

        For this project i was able to grasp a relatively good under-
standing of all the utilities on a highier level but when assuming
no correct input and all the errors that can be thrown in tandem with
all of the little details i over looked in my breakout this project
turned into quite a bit of work.
	For the kill utility the hardest part was mapping the signals 
to there correct integer value, but i was able to come up with clever
way to do that i never discussed in my breakout because i was unaware
that that would even become a problem.
	Thanks to Supa' Mike i was able to review and study the penv
and pwd utilities for how to aproach some of the other utilities.
	The stat utility was not really a surprise at all from when 
i wrote my breakout it was just a bunch of symantic formatting of all
the data in the stat struct
	The ln utility was actually much simpler then i precieved it 
to be at the time of the breakout.  I had known about the link 
function but assumed i would have to manipulate that function for the
-S option not realizing there already was a symlink function
	The remove function was one of the ones that caught me for some
time.  The traditional rm was very easy with the unlink function but 
the -R option made things a bit tougher.  Requiring me to search through
the directory clear it and then remove it.
	The cat utility was increadbly easy and most of my source code
i pulled from my own lab 06 modifying the directed output to the stand-
ard output. The only thing that i was not prepared for was what GNU's
version does when no argument file is included which is to mirror user 
input.
	I worked much much more on the chmod from lab 09 but by this
point Supa's MIke went over it so much that i was well aware of how
to implement it.
	The ls utility was a glorified version of the stat utility
and i fully understood how to implement it when writing my breakout.
The only shacky part was modding the uid and gid as well as the time.
	The mv and cp functions are very closely related and we fairly
simple.  I was able to implement them just as i planned in my breakout
other then the -R option of cp which has bested me
	The Mkdir utility was no surprise from the breakout given that
the system call does most of the work for you.  The only difficult part
was supporting the -p option which has also bested me although i left 
my algorithm because i think i was very close.
